# devotee

A bit personal visualization engine.

`devotee` is directly based on:
- [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) - Rust windowing library;
- [pixels](https://crates.io/crates/pixels) - `wgpu`-based pixel renderer;
- [rodio](https://crates.io/crates/rodio) - `cpal`-based audio playback library;

## Work in progress

`devotee` is totally a work in progress.
We'd suggest to avoid relying on it in a long term yet.

## Examples

To run examples first check which are available:
```
cargo run --example
```

Then run the desired one with
```
cargo run --example <example_name>
```
